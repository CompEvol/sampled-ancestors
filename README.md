sampled-ancestors
=================

[![Build Status](https://github.com/CompEvol/sampled-ancestors/workflows/Unit%2Fintegration%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CompEvol/sampled-ancestors/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Unit%2Fintegration+tests%22)

This [BEAST 2](http://www.beast2.org) package provides MCMC proposals and post-processing tools for samples of trees containing sampled ancestors. 
It relies on the support for sampled-ancestor trees built into the `beast.evolution.tree.Tree` class (https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2/blob/master/src/beast/evolution/tree/Tree.java).

This archive contains the source code of the package and is therefore of
primary interest to programmers.

The paper describing this package is:

Alexandra Gavryushkina, David Welch, Tanja Stadler, Alexei J. Drummond (2014) Bayesian Inference of Sampled Ancestor Trees for Epidemiology and Fossil Calibration. _PLoS Computational Biology_ https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003919

Currently the sampled-ancestors package uses `beast.*` Java package namespace, which is now deprecated because the `beast.*` package namespace is reserved for the beast2 core (https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2).

Building package from source
----------------------------

To build this package from source, ensure you have the following installed:

* OpenJDK version 17 or greater
* A recent version of OpenJFX
* The Apache Ant build system
* An internet connection
The internet connection is required since the build script downloads the most
recent version of the BEAST 2 source to build the package against.

Assuming both Java and Ant are on your execution path and your current working
directory is the root of directory this archive, simply type

```sh
JAVA_FX_HOME=/path/to/openjfx/ ant
```

from the command line to build the package. This may take up to a minute due
to the script fetching the BEAST source, and the resulting binary will be
left in the `/dist` directory.

To run the unit tests, use "ant test".


Archive Contents
----------------

* `README.md` : this file
* `build.xml` : Ant build script
* `/doc` : Contains additional documentation, currently a tutorial for using fossilized birth-death tree prior.
* `/examples` : Example analyses in beast2 xml format. See below for details.
* `/src` : source files. See below for details.
* `/test` : unit tests
* `/templates` : BEAUti templates. See below for details.
* `version.xml` : BEAST package version file.

The main Java packages and folders in the sampled-ancestors BEAST2 package are: 

### `beast.app.simulators`

Contains simulators for the fossilized birth-death (FBD) model and FBD-skyline model.

### `beast.app.tools`

* Contains conversion tools between zero-branch-length sampled-ancestor trees and native sampled-ancestor trees
* Contains `SATreeTraceAnalysis` and various other post-processing tools and support
		
### `beast.evolution.operators`
		
* Contains the operators that permit MCMC on sampled-ancestor trees

### `beast.evolution.speciation`

Contains `SpeciesTreeDistribution` calculations for the FBD prior:

* `SABirthDeathModel` - A species tree probability density of FBD prior with multiple hard-coded parameterizations possible. 
* `ParameterizedSABirthDeathModel` -  A species tree probability density with multiple parameterizations implemented in an object-oriented way.

### `templates`

Contains a template called `FBD.xml` which provides a template for `SABirthDeathModel` and sampled-ancestor tree operators.
